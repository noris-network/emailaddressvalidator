# What is it?

This is a simple library for email address validation.

It only recognizes the simple form of an email address, like this one:

```
joe.frobisher@example.com
```

It does *not* recognize the more complex form consisting of name and email,
like this one:

```
Joe Frobisher <joe.frobisher@example.com>
```

# Installation

Just do

```
$ pip install emailaddressvalidator
```
